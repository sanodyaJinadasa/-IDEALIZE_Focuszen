## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📦 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sanodyaJinadasa/-IDEALIZE_Focuszen.git
cd focuszen
```

---

### ⚙️ Laravel Setup

```bash
composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
php artisan serve
```

> 🔐 **Note:** Fill in your database credentials and API keys in the `.env` file.

---

### 🤖 Flask AI Setup (Motivational Engine)

```bash
cd Flask

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
# or
source venv/bin/activate    # macOS/Linux

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start Flask server
python app.py
```

This will run the motivational engine at:  
`http://127.0.0.1:5000/motivate?minutes=45`

---

## 🔐 API Key Security

> ⚠️ **Important Security Note**

An OpenAI API key was **accidentally committed earlier** and has since been **revoked and removed**.  
The current repository is safe and `.env` is correctly **excluded** from version control.

### ✅ API Key Best Practices

- Store secrets like `OPENAI_API_KEY` inside your `.env` file.
- Never commit `.env` to GitHub – it should always be in `.gitignore`.
- Use `.env.example` to show required variables (without real values).
